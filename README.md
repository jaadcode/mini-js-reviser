üìù JavaScript ES6+ Practice Project

This project is designed to review and practice modern JavaScript (ES6+) concepts while building small exercises and a mini front-end application.
The goal is to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript features, the DOM, asynchronous programming, and working with APIs.

‚∏ª

üìö Topics Covered
	1.	ES6+ Syntax
	‚Ä¢	let / const
	‚Ä¢	Arrow functions () => {}
	‚Ä¢	Template literals `${var}`
	‚Ä¢	Destructuring objects and arrays
	‚Ä¢	Default parameters
	‚Ä¢	Spread & Rest operators
	2.	DOM Manipulation
	‚Ä¢	Selecting elements (querySelector, getElementById)
	‚Ä¢	Modifying elements (innerText, innerHTML, classList)
	‚Ä¢	Creating new elements and appending them
	‚Ä¢	Handling events (addEventListener)
	3.	Asynchronous JavaScript
	‚Ä¢	setTimeout and setInterval
	‚Ä¢	Promises
	‚Ä¢	async/await
	‚Ä¢	Error handling with try/catch
	4.	Working with APIs
	‚Ä¢	Using fetch to get data
	‚Ä¢	Parsing JSON responses
	‚Ä¢	Handling errors
	‚Ä¢	Displaying API data dynamically

üí° Exercises

1Ô∏è‚É£ ES6 Basics
	‚Ä¢	Convert old var code to let/const.
	‚Ä¢	Rewrite a function using arrow syntax.
	‚Ä¢	Destructure an object and an array.
	‚Ä¢	Use template literals to build a dynamic string.

2Ô∏è‚É£ DOM Manipulation
	‚Ä¢	Create a button that changes the text of a paragraph when clicked.
	‚Ä¢	Create a list that grows as you add items through an input field.
	‚Ä¢	Add/remove classes dynamically on click.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Async JS
	‚Ä¢	Write a function that logs a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout.
	‚Ä¢	Convert a simple Promise to async/await.
	‚Ä¢	Create a function that simulates an API call using Promise.resolve().

4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch API
	‚Ä¢	Fetch data from JSONPlaceholder or another public API.
	‚Ä¢	Display a list of users/posts/items dynamically in the DOM.
	‚Ä¢	Handle errors (invalid URLs, network problems) with try/catch.

üéØ Mini Project Ideas

Pick one or more ideas to practice and combine the concepts:
	‚Ä¢	Weather App: Input a city, fetch weather data from an API, and display it.
	‚Ä¢	Recipe Finder: Input an ingredient, fetch recipes from an API, and display a list.
	‚Ä¢	Simple Dashboard: Display a list of users/posts, allow adding/removing items, style it minimally.

‚∏ª

üíª How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/js-es6-practice.git

	2.	Open index.html in your browser.
	3.	Start coding in script.js and see the changes live.

üìå Notes
	‚Ä¢	Commit often and write meaningful commit messages.
	‚Ä¢	Try to implement each exercise before looking at solutions.
	‚Ä¢	Keep your code clean and readable.
	‚Ä¢	Use this project as a portfolio piece once finished.
